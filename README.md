This is a time and attendance system developed to be used in a real working environment. The system involves using a set of punch in machines connected to a MySQL database. The written code mainly handles adjusting the punch ins to the correct 
time stamp and then calculating when they were clocked in and out. But there are many secondary functions like calcuating total accrued hours. The project also includes a series of unit tests to catch any obvious design flaws.
